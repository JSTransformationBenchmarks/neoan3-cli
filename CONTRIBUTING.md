# Contibuting

## Targeted audience

It does make sense to be familiar with NodeJS and PHP, but at the very least Node and composer.

You should understand the basics of neoan3 and its concepts before contributing.

**That said, everyone is welcome to contribute**

## Pull requests

We welcome your pull requests coming from **your fork** to the target branch **code-review**. 
We highly recommend committing your local changes to a different branch than master.

## FAQ

_Can I add myself to contributers in the package.json?_

Absolutely!

_Can I make changes to the README if required?_

Yes. In such a case, it probably makes sense to divide your changes in two PRs for an easier reviewing process.
